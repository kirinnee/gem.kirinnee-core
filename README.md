# Kirinnee Core

Personal core library that monkey patches basic types such as string and enumerable with utility method.
How each method is used is list below.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kirinnee_core'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kirinnee_core

## Usage

### Enumerable
Here are the monkey patched methods for enumerable

---
##### where `predicate`
Filters based on predicate passed via block. Variant of `select`, `filter` and `find_all` in ruby.

Does not mutate original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3].where {|x| x%2!=0 } # => [1,3]
```

##### where! `predicate`
Filters base on predicate passed via block.
Variant of `select`, `filter`, `find_all` method in ruby

Mutates the original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3].where! { |x| x%2!=0 } # => [1,3]
```

##### skip `x`
Skips the first x elements of the enumerable

Does not mutate the original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3,4,5].skip 3 #=> [4,5]
{:a=>1, :b=>2, :c=>3, :d=>4, :e=>5}.skip 3 #=> {:d=>4, :e=>5}
```

##### skip_while `predicate`
Skips the elements of the enumerable while the predicate evaluates to true

Does not mutate the original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3,2,1,0].skip_while {|x| x < 3} # => [3,2,1,0]
```

##### back `x`
Takes the last x element of the enumerable

Does not mutate the original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3,4,5,6].back 3 #=> [4,5,6]
[1,2,3,4,5,6].back 100 #=> [1,2,3,4,5,6]
[1,2,3,4,5,6].back 0 #=> []
```

##### back_while `predicate`
Takes the last x element while predicate evaluates to true

Does not mutate the original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3,2,1,0].back_while {|x| x <2} # => [1,0]
```

##### omit `x`
Omits the last x element of the enumerable

Does not mutate the original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3,4,5].omit 2 # => [1,2,3]
[1,2,3,4,5].omit 100 #=> []
[1,2,3,4,5].omit 0 # => [1,2,3,4,5]
```

##### omit_while `predicate`
Omits the last element while the predicate evaluates to true
 
Does not mutate the original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3,2,1,0].omit_while { |x| x <3} #=> [1,2,3]
```

##### remove `search`
Removes all occurrences of the element within the enumerable

Does not mutate the original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3,1,2,3].remove 3 #=> [1,2,1,2]
%w(apple pear apple pear).remove "apple" #=> %w(pear pear)
```

##### has? `search`
Whether the enumerable contains at least 1 element that matches the input
```ruby
[1,2,3,4,5,6,1].has? 1 # true
[1,2,3,4,5,6,1].has? 2 # true
[1,2,3,4,5,6,1].has? 7 # false
```

##### without `array`
Remove all occurrences of each element in provided array from target array

Does not mutate the original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4].without [2,4] #=> [1,3,1,3]
```
##### without_index `indexes`
Remove all occurrences of each element in provided array from target array

Does not mutate the original enumerable
```ruby
[1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4].without [2,4] #=> [1,3,1,3]
```

##### indexes `predicate`
Gets the indexes that matches the predicate

Does not mutate the original enumerable
```ruby
[6,5,4,3,2].indexes {|x| x < 4} # => [3,4]
```

### String
Here are the monkey patched methods for Strings

---

Does not mutate original string
```ruby
"a=>b=>c".replace_all("=>","-") # => "a-b-c"

Mutates original string
```ruby
"a=>b=>c".replace_all!("=>","-") # => "a-b-c"
```

##### take `x`
